    "## Why PARC?\n",
    "<p>PARC brings together deep learning with first prinicples physics - its recurrent convolutional core is able to learn complex spatiotemporal patterns, while built-in biases (conservation laws & advection-diffusion operators) ensure every prediction is physically plausible. PARC is constructed in such a manner that is does not need to \"re-learn\" fundemental dynamics - allowing faster training with far less data.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>PINN (Physics-Informed Neural Networks) exists as an adjacent model to PARC. While PINN may preform decently on generics, it struggles with advection or chaotic/non-linear systems - net leading to higher computational cost. In such situations PARC is deemed the superior model with it being more scalable, efficient, and accurate than other physics-based models.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "<p>The goal of this notebook is to walk you through the use cases of PARC via the Navier-Stokes equation. At the end of this notebook you will be presented with visualization in accordance to the equations representing conservation of momentum for fluids and fully describing fluid motion.</p>\n",
